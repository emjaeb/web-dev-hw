# *My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo*

## Emma Bryant

As a student who is one upper-division course away from graduating with a BA in studio art, I honestly am very intimidated by computers and software. While this will fulfill my last upper-div 3 credits, I am taking this course in hopes that it teaches me useful skills that I will be able to use in everyday life while creating a website for my artwork. I am excited to get to know my computer better, and to be learning all new skills along the way!

A few things I have learned so far (where to start...)

* The internet and the world wide web are connected, but ultimately are different from one another

* No one person/corporation controls the internet

* Watching the live usage of emojis and seeing the sheer number of posts, likes, shares, etc. across social media platforms was ASTOUNDING!! Imagine if we were able to see all statistics like this - how many babies are born every minute, how many people die every minute, how often someone sneezes...it would be incredible (in both a positive and negative way) to be able to track every part of our lives like this does
