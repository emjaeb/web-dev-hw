# Assignment 2

A version control system is essentially a bookkeeping record of everything that has ever been added, removed, or amended during the coding process. Whenever a user runs into an issue, the VCS allows said user to backtrack each step they have taken in the code to see where things went awry. Alternately, if a user is working on a project and instead of running into an issue they simply want to revert to how things looked before adjustments were made to the code, it allows the user to re-instate to the previous, preferred version. While still learning the basics of coding/web design, this allows all of us as students to see where things went wrong & learn from our mistakes!

This cycle was really about trying to memorize and utilize all of these links, codes, etc. without having to refer back to learning material. The one issue I ran into was starting this assignment, saving it, coming back to it a day later, and finding that my Github Desktop wasn't liking all of the additions/changes I was making to this HW assignment. I kept renaming files, moving them around, and somehow eventually was able to make my systems talk to one another again - I honestly couldn't really tell you what I did to make this happen (other than maybe the classic turn-it-off-then-back-on-again trick...)
