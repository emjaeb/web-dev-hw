      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>As a Fiddle Leaf Fig owner, you already know how finicky these beautiful trees can be! Below is a step-by-step guide for ensuring your baby is happy and healthy in it's new planter.</p>
      <b>Materials needed...</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Your big, beautiful Fiddle Leaf Fig</li>
        <li>The new planter - this should be ~2-3 inches larger than the current one</li>
        <li>Potting soil - I mix cactus & moisture control (did I mention these trees are needy?)</li>
        <li>Something to protect your floor from all of the dirt (optional)</li>
        <li>Gardening gloves to protect your hands (also optional)</li>
      <ul>
    </div>

    <div id="three" class="container">
      <h2>STEP ONE</h2>
      <p>Gently remove your Fiddle Leaf from the current pot - gently press in the sides if it's in a plastic planter until it gives. If it's in a hard-sided planter, stick a gardening tool (I like to use butter knives) to loosen up the edges.</p>
      <p>The entire root system should come out all in one piece (try not to break up the soil <i><b>too</b></i> much! I'm telling you, these trees are TOUCHY!)
      <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> if your new planter is WITHOUT a drainage system (i.e. small hole at the base of the planter,) fill the bottom ~1-2 inches of the of the pot with gravel to help water drain. This helps to avoid deathly root rot.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="two" class="container">
      <h2>STEP TWO</h2>
      <p>Line the bottom of the planter with some of our yummy soil mixture, and then carefully place your tree in the pot. Double check to make sure it's centered, and leave ~2-3 inches from the top of the root system to the top of the new planter.</p>
      <p>Pack more soil mixture around and above your tree's new resting place. If the soil isn't fully packed down, you may need to add more mix after the first couple of waterings once things have shifted.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="three" class="container">
      <h2>STEP THREE</h2>
      <p>Let your baby get to know it's new surroundings! Keep it out of direct, harsh sunlight and withhold water for 1-2 days after repotting - give it time to breathe and settle in.</p>
      <p>Remember to give the leaves a little bath using a washcloth and a bit of warm water - any dust on the leaves prevents them from soaking up necessary sunshine. This is good to do every few weeks, as needed.</p>
